## Dataset- Kaggle.com

Kaggle is one of the most competative dataset available on-line. Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Kaggle allows usder to find and publish data sets, and build projects related to data-science field. It allows users to work woth other data science developers and machine learning engineers and partipate in the challenges.

The dataset that I have choosen is "Latest Covid 19 India Statewise Data". The reason why I opted for this dataset is because the dataset is great for explotary analysis. IThe dataset contains the details about the number of states and UT in India. Number of active access, number of confirmed cases, total  number of deaths per state, number of discharged cases, ratio of number of active cases to total number of cases,ratio of number of death to total cases. With teh help of this dataset, we will be able to track number of upcoming cases, cases per state, predit future death rates and decide on the protocol to reduce the transmission of the virus.\

The book approaches more towards critical and problem solving skills. Data Science as a profession and academic discipline is recently born and the book acts as a child to the mature parental disciplines of scientific methods, data and software engineering, statistics and visualization. This book is proficient to introduce parallel processing, map-reduce computing, SQL, Tableau, no SQL databases, advance statistics and complexity science. This book also covers the basic introduction to Java, Python, Hadoop, MYSQL, Matlab ,SPSS, SAS, etc . Overall, this book will help student to get a basic knowledge of all the aspects involved in data science.

This book is on special interest to me as it allows me to explore all the topics taht is related to data analysis and data science. Various programming tools, databases , data visualzation toll can be learnt form this test book.
