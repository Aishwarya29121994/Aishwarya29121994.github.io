It allows users to work woth other data science developers and machine learning engineers and partipate in the challenges.

The dataset that I have choosen is "Latest Covid 19 India Statewise Data". The reason why I opted for this dataset is because the dataset is great for explotary analysis. IThe dataset contains the details about the number of states and UT in India. Number of active access, number of confirmed cases, total  number of deaths per state, number of discharged cases, ratio of number of active cases to total number of cases,ratio of number of death to total cases. With teh help of this dataset, we will be able to track number of upcoming cases, cases per state, predit future death rates and decide on the protocol to reduce the transmission of the virus.
